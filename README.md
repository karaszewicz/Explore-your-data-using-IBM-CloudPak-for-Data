# Explore your data using IBM CloudPak for Data

In this Tutorial, we will perform data engineering operations on multiple datasets using IBM Watson Data Refinery on IBM Cloud Pak for Data or Watson Studio on IBM Cloud.

A data scientist cannot directly build a model based on the dataset. The data collection and analysis is very essential before building a model. In this tutorial, we demonstrate how you can easily collect data from databases, analyze the data, and enhance the data according to requirements with the help of IBM Watson Data Refinery on IBM Cloud Pak for Data or Watson Studio on IBM Cloud.

## Learning objectives
When you have completed this tutorial, you will understand how to:

- Create a set of ordered steps to cleanse, shape, and enhance data
- Create a connection with any database and Watson Data Refinery
- Prepare datasets specific to your ML Model
- Save the datasets in any database of your choice
